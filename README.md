Have you ever questioned when the ideal time of year is to reserve a hotel room? Alternatively, how long should I remain to get the greatest daily rate? What if you wanted to foretell whether a hotel would unreasonably frequently receive unusual requests? You can investigate those questions using the data from hotel reservations! This data collection comprises reservation details for a city hotel and a resort hotel, as well as details like the date the reservation was made, the duration of the stay, the number of adults, kids, and/or babies, and the number of parking spaces that are available. The data is devoid of any information that may be used to identify a specific person.

In this project I explored this dataset with a goal in my mind to find out hidden insights in the data that could help the hotels to grow their business. To perform the analysis I used python packages like pandas and for visualization used matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Approach I followed is to make use visualization to find out underlying trends and patterns among the features, and with the help of my business acumen generated insights. Insights are in the conclusion section at bottom.
